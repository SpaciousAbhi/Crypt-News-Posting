# config.yaml

# A list of forwarding tasks. Each task is a dictionary defining the
# sources, targets, and AI modifications.
#
# IMPORTANT: You must use numerical Channel IDs for sources and targets, not
# usernames (e.g., @channel_name).
#
# How to find a Channel ID:
# 1. Forward a message from the channel to a bot like @userinfobot.
# 2. The bot will reply with the channel's ID (it's usually a negative number).
